# Walt-Disney-World
This application was created in order for patrons to review wait times for the rides at Walt Disney World as well as rate their experience at the park.

This application works by taking in the users log in information or allow a new user to register. Upon logging in, you are then directed to a map of Walt Disney World and you are able to choose which land you would like to access the information on. After choosing from the selection you are directed to a page of the Walt Disney World land you have chosen with information. You are able to choose which ride from the list of rides within that land.
