# Walt-Disney-World
This application was created in order for patrons to review wait times for the rides at Walt Disney World as well as rate their experience at the park.

This application works by taking in the users log in information or allow a new user to register. You are then taken to a map of Walt Disney World where you are able to choose which land you would like to find information on. You are then taken to a page of the Walt Disney World land you have chosen. You are able to choose which ride from the list of rides within that land.

This application was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Handlebars
